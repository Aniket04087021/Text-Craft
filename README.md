# Text Craft

Text Craft is a modern, web-based text editor that allows users to write, format, and style their text with ease, just like a design platform such as Canva. With a user-friendly interface, you can create rich text content, customize fonts, colors, and alignments, and save your work.

## Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: Supports bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and more.
- **Custom Fonts & Colors**: Choose from a wide range of fonts and colors.
- **Text Alignment**: Align text left, center, right, or justify.
- **Lists**: Create ordered and unordered lists.
- **Text Styling**: Set custom font size, font family, and text color.
- **Download/Export**: Save your work locally in various formats such as `.txt` or `.html`.



## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the text editor for an aesthetically pleasing design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, enabling real-time text editing, formatting, and saving options.
